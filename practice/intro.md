## Python exercises

## R exercises

To practice R exercises, I am going to suggest you to use the excellent `swirlr` course.
Here's how to try it:


1. Open RStudio
2. In the Rstudio console type: `install.packages("swirl")`
3. Once done installing, type: `library("swirl")`
4. Choose Option 1: “1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R”

There are interactive exercises with feedback that you can go through.
